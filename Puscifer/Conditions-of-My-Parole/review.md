# Track notes

## Tiny Monsters
A little slow to get going. Not quite my cup of tea. It gets better. A little slow with a slight mellow tinge.

## Green Valley

- Nice start.
- Has a nice rift which is clear around the 2:50 mark.

## Monsoons

- A little electronica in the mix.
- Not what I have come to expect from Puscifer, yet I like it. Ever so slightly Enya esq yet without the Irish female voice.

## Telling Ghosts

- Great intro
- Could be a nice song to have a few glasses of wine to.
